		Lyrics:
<br>Here comes a wave
<br>Meant to wash me away
<br>A tide that is taking me under
<br>Left with nothing to say
<br>My voice drowned out in the thunder
<br>But I won't cry
<br>And I won't start to crumble
<br>Whenever they try
<br>To shut me or cut me down
<br>I won't be silenced
<br>You can't keep me quiet
<br>Won't tremble when you try it
<br>All I know is I won't go speechless
<br>'Cause I'll breathe
<br>When they try to suffocate me
<br>Don't you underestimate me
<br>'Cause I know that I won't go speechless
<br>Written in stone
<br>Every rule, every word
<br>Centuries old and unbending
<br>Stay in your place
<br>Better seen and not heard
<br>But now that story is ending
<br>'Cause I
<br>I cannot start to crumble
<br>So come on and try
<br>Try to shut me and cut me down
<br>I won't be silenced
<br>You can't keep me quiet
<br>Won't tremble when you try it
<br>All I know is I won't go speechless
<br>Speechless
<br>Let the storm in
<br>I cannot be broken
<br>No, I won't live unspoken
<br>'Cause I know that I won't go speechless
<br>Try to lock me in this cage
<br>I won't just lay me down and die
<br>I will take these broken wings
<br>And watch me burn across the sky
<br>Hear the echoes saying I
<br>Won't be silenced
<br>Though you want to see me tremble when you try it
<br>All I know is I won't go speechless
<br>Speechless
<br>'Cause I'll breathe
<br>When they try to suffocate me
<br>Don't you underestimate me
<br>'Cause I know that I won't go speechless
<br>All I know is I won't go speechless
<br>Speechless
